- Consistent spacing and typography
- Smooth animations and transitions

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading of images
- Efficient state management
- Optimized API calls with caching
- Minimal re-renders

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for enhancement:
- Add search functionality
- Implement infinite scroll
- Add more filter options
- Enhance accessibility
- Add unit and integration tests
- Add PWA support
